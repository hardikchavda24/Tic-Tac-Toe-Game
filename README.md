# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This code creates a responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players alternate between "O" and "X". The game checks for a winner based on predefined patterns and displays a message when a winner is found. Players can reset or start a new game. The design adjusts for different screen sizes.
